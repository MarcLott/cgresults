All across the U.S., Tobacco 21 possesses been convincing communities to raise the legal smoking age from 18 to 21. Since vaping is also being mounted on these age raising initiatives, for most vape shop owners or eLiquid Producers, this may feel in the end threatening for lowering potential consumers.

Even though many in the vape community recognize that using vapor products is in no way equal to the act of smoking, on the other hand the opposition has been able to successfully equate both.

__Why would this seem threatening to companies in the vape space?__

Well, the remedy is quite simple and that is because if persons who are 18-20 years of age use vapor goods, they can no more pay for them from a vape store. So, these new guidelines quickly affect organization in a significant way. Thousands of individuals are immediately exempt from purchasing vapor goods.

## Flavour Bans

At the same time, another circumstance affecting the vape industry over the United States, specifically in California, we are seeing flavour bans going into effect at a rapid pace. In the end linking the banning of tobacco flavours, like menthol smoking cigarettes or fruity cigars, to the a large number of eLiquid flavours alternatives to choose from.

Once again, when you compare smoking products like smoking cigarettes and cigars to vapor products, this certainly seems as an odd contradiction, measuring quite dissimilar and rather different products.

Certainly vapor products have been deemed to be looked at as tobacco by the FDA, but vapor products include heat nicotine while cigarettes consist of burning tobacco. Clearly, both of these processes won't be the same.

Specifically because combustible tobacco has been associated with disease and vaporizing nicotine is employed just as a harm reduction tool for smokers. Most are well-aware of the popular conclusion launched by the Royal School of Physicians, who've informed the general public that vaping is 95-99% less harmful than smoking.

Unfortunately in the us, this professional and prestigious evidence is under no circumstances embraced or considered by the flavour ban supporters - which is comprised of several different groups within the general public health sector and tobacco control industry.

## Advocacy Efforts

Respectfully, various vape advocacy groups, trade teams and active individual advocates took a variety of methods to combat the tobacco 21 ordinances and so are trying to guard against the pass on of unnecessary flavour bans.

Furthermore, both of these attempts at damaging the vape sector are without a doubt meant to serve an objective. Whether that initial purpose was to divide advocacy work, this is accurately what has happened.

This is not to say that half of the advocacy community tries to combat T21 ordinances as the spouse has been centered on fighting against flavour ban initiatives.

Instead, all the effective teams and influential advocates assisting the vape sector typically attempt to create chances and embrace tactics which can help combat both anti-vape establishment attacks.

## Choosing Battles Wisely

In retrospect, when looking at both issues, vape product consumers and vape advocates need to consider weighing the professionals and cons of each strategic attack. Perhaps it's time to realize where in fact the bigger threat lies.

Is raising the legal time to purchase vape products creating more harm to the preservation of vapor goods? Or, happen to be these rampant flavour bans producing a lot more destruction for the vape sector?

In hindsight, it appears that native flavour bans and a good possible countrywide flavour ban would finally destroy the vapor industry. Yes, the looming tobacco 21 age raises are certainly disastrous to the commerce of vapor items, but a prohibition on products seems like the precursor to destroying the vape way of life.

One thing is for certain, both these situations are easily two of the biggest issues advocates have already been dealing with. Though, perhaps more energy should be focused on  flavour ban prevention rather than splitting period on Tobacco 21 battles. Reducing the buyer base hurts business, but prohibiting the merchandise kills the complete industry.
