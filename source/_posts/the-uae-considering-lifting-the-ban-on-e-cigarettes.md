Previous March, a UAE senior health official said that the united states was focusing on devising regulations that could stop the against the law import of e-cigarettes, pursuing which anyone caught smuggling the devices would face criminal costs.

Head of the National Tobacco Control Committee, Dr Wedad Al Maidoor, said that even while no time frame had been specified because of this regulation, it was first a necessary step, "sell of the e-cigarettes available in the country have not been imported, since no import expectations have been specified. So, they will be smuggled," she explained.

Thankfully, this stance may be changing just as Government consumer watchdog, the Emirates Authority for Standardisation and Metrology (Esma), happens to be reviewing the scientific data over alternative tobacco products, within a plan to establish whether the ban should be lifted.

## PMI is ready to pounce

PMI has only released results from a report indicating that its HnB product IQOS, can decrease the incidence and multiplicity of lung carcinomas in a cancer animal model, in comparison with regular cigarettes.

Effortlessly, Philip Morris International (PMI), who has been doing its utmost to push its digital camera iQOS in as much markets simply because possible to make up for the dwindling cigarettes sales, regards the UAE market simply because a golden opportunity.

"He assume that Esma is seriously considering how to best regulate all novel tobacco items to ensure product safety and the best quality,: stated Lana Gamal El Din, director of corporate affairs at PMI.

"At PMI we support all varieties of transparent collaboration with authorities, Esma included, and we follow national requirements in virtually any given nation. The UAE is normally an important market for us, and we desire to provide the product here beneath the enough regulatory framework."

More data indicating that iQOS bears less health risks than cigarettes
Just last Thursday, the tobacco giant, released findings from a report indicating that its heat-not-burn device, IQOS, can decrease the incidence and multiplicity of lung carcinomas in a cancers animal model, in comparison with regular cigarettes.

However, PMI's efforts at appearing mainly because having harm reduction in mind, have faced some major setbacks. An article published by Reuters in December 2017, had revealed that former PMI staff members who were mixed up in scientific trials for iQOS, possessed reported several irregularities in the research process.

Yet, consistent with PMI's findings, a recently available study simply by the independent Committee in Toxicity of Chemicals found in Food, Consumer Goods and the Environment (COT), which reviewed several 'heat-not-burn' tobacco products, in addition has indicated that the devices are safer than regular cigarettes.

## Tobacco tax to come to be introduced in the UAE

For the very first time, Dubai and the rest of the UAE are set to introduce a tobacco excise tax that's expected to reduce the local tobacco demand by about 40%.

The United Arab Emirates (UAE), better referred to as the nation Dubai causes part of, is notorious to be relatively free of tax and for still selling cigarettes at ridiculously low prices. However, as from the 1st of October a radical transformation is set to occur, as an excise taxes of 100% on tobacco  is being introduced.

"Tobacco taxes will be the most cost-effective method to reduce tobacco work with, especially among youthful and the indegent. A tax boost that increases tobacco prices by 10 % decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 % in high-profit countries and about 5 % in low- and middle-income countries."

In line with the World Health Group (Just who), a 10% tobacco price increase brings about a 4% decrease in usage. This would mean a 40% decrease in tobacco use across the nation.

"Tobacco taxes are the most cost-effective approach to reduce tobacco work with, especially among little and the indegent. A tax rise that increases tobacco rates by 10 per cent decreases tobacco consumption by about 4 % in high-profit countries and about 5 % in low- and middle-profits countries," said the WHO, which applauds countries that impose such heavy taxes.

According to a written report by the organization, among UAE nationals aged above 15, 28.6% of males and 0.7% females smoke, whilst cigarette prices are significantly low. The cheapest cigarettes are Lucky Hit which promote at Dh3 ( $0.8) a good pack, whilst an average brand like Marlboro markets at Dh11 ( $3.00).

"Raising tobacco taxes so that they account for at least 70 per cent of retail prices would result in significant selling price increases, induce various current users to give up and deter many youth from taking on tobacco use, resulting in large reductions in the death and disease due to tobacco use. As well, such tax increases will generate significant boosts in tobacco taxes revenues."
