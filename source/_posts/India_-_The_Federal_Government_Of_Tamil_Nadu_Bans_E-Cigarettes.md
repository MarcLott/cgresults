Following advisory issued by India’s health ministry before this month, stating that e-cigarettes should be banned, the southern point out of Tamil Nadu has banned the manufacturing, sales distribution, use and possession of e-cigarettes, citing health hazards.

Before this month, India’s federal overall health ministry issued an advisory addressed to Indian condition Governments, calling for a ban on the subject of the revenue and imports of electronic smoking cigarettes and heat-not-burn devices. Medical ministry stated that the devices certainly are a “certainly are a great well being risk to the general public most importantly, especially to kids, adolescents, women that are pregnant and girls of reproductive age”.

E-cigarettes have been banned in in least 6 claims including Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and today the Tamil Nadu government has followed suit.

Banning the tested safer alternatives will become detrimental to public health

Consistent with arguments by health bodies from around the world such as General public Health England (PHE), the Association of Vapers India (AVI), an organisation that represents e-cigarette users in the united states, has spoken against these measures.

It really is ironic that while the government picks about the tested safer alternatives, smoking cigarettes remain widely available.

“ENDS products are being examined around the world because of their benefit in harm decrease and as a good pathway to smoking cessation. The advisory should be withdrawn promptly…,” noted a let go released by the group before this month.
The organization is now taking legal advice how to approach the judiciary against the order, and has recently submitted research papers to the Talk about Health Administration, showing that e-cigarettes are up to 95% safer than regular cigarettes.

Why ban e-cigs, when smoking cigarettes remain widely available?
Talking about the ban in Tamil Nadu, the director of the AVI Samrat Chowdhery, once more stated that it's ironic that as the authorities picks on the tested safer alternatives, cigarettes stay widely available.

“The Tamil Nadu government has hit a fresh low in anti-people policy by banning use and possession of e-cigarettes with their sale. In the mean time, an even more harmful product, cigarette, is still sold freely and based on the national GATS-2 study, the quantity of smokers in the talk about are rising, that your government has didn't curb.”

“The state has overlooked credible and vast evidence on the harm reduction potential of e-cigarettes to impose a ban that may have a negative effect on public health”, added Chowdhery.

Scientists on why banning e-cigarettes found in India is an epic mistake
As the Indian government is considering implementing a ban on electronic cigarettes, Indian researchers are attractive to local authorities to conduct “India centric exploration before making a decision on any hasty maneuver”.

Last year two scientists, R.N. Sharan of the Section of Biochemistry, North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU), and M. Siddiqi, Chairman of Cancer Basis of India wrote a letter to the Union Health and Friends and family Welfare Minister J.P. Nadda, urging him to consider policies that facilitate cigarette smoking cessation by giving smokers with safe and regulated tobacco alternatives.

“The Electronic Smoking Delivery Program (ENDS), more popularly referred to as e-cigarettes, offer a safer and effective way of meeting the physiological needs of nicotine to smokers to greatly help quit or decrease smoking significantly,” they said, after pointing out that in countries such as the UK, the products are freely available leading to a substantial decline in smoking.

Digital cigarettes could reverse India’s smoking epidemic

A study carried out last year, discovered that making e-cigs accessible in India would reduce the amount of smokers by 50%, which would equate to keeping around 90 million life-years.

Additionally, a study also carried out this past year simply by US non-profit organization Reason Foundation, discovered that the result of vaping products becoming extra accessible and sold at considerably more competitive prices in India, would naturally bring about even more smokers switching to vaping. The experts calculated that the amount of smokers could decrease by 50% or even more within the following twenty years, which would mean keeping around 90 million life-years. “In 30 years, vaping might eradicate smoking altogether,” concluded the analysis.

India has a very serious tobacco issue and regrettably the second largest using tobacco population on the planet. Yet, all this info that could contribute to reversing the problem went unnoticed. Before this season the Union Wellbeing Ministry formed a working group to assess the effect of the merchandise on localized vapers, in an attempt to find out whether a ban is very necessary. This committee figured the products have cancer-causing homes, and are highly addictive, predicated on which the Union federal government is looking at implementing a ban.

“We believe that general public health in India reaches a larger risk under a good prohibitive environment than by allowing smokers, who want to cease tobacco work with, an alternative option based on nicotine alternative via e-cigarettes.”

Scientists send a second letter to Indian Union Minister
Dr. Siddiqi and Prof. Sharan happen to be speaking up again. They have created yet another letter tackled to the Union Minister, urging him to avert a public wellbeing disaster by regulating digital cigarettes rather than ban them. “We assume that public health in India is at a larger risk under a prohibitive environment than by permitting smokers, who wish to cease tobacco employ, an alternative option predicated on nicotine replacement via e-cigarettes.” stated Prof. Sharan.

Consistent with what several research have already been indicating, the scientists remarked that the devices have been shown to bring about decreased smoking prices in the countries where they have been endorsed. Infact, thanks to the arrival of vaping, the united kingdom who has totally endorsed the devices within smoking cessation courses, is reporting the cheapest number of smokers ever recorded.

“At the same time when there keeps growing support for e-smoking cigarettes in many countries it is regrettable that India appears to be moving in a poor direction. Given the level of tobacco use in India there is definitely huge prospect of tobacco harm reduction.”
 Prof. R.N. Sharan, Department of Biochemistry, North-Eastern Hill University (NEHU)

“At the same time when there is growing support for e-smoking cigarettes in many countries it really is regrettable that India is apparently moving in a poor direction. Given the scale of tobacco use in India there is normally huge prospect of tobacco harm lowering.” said Prof. Sharan.
